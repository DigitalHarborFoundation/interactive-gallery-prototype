# Interactive Project Gallery

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

This project was replaced with Gatsby for v2, but v3 is now in progress. I may deploy this old version for comparision, but for now there isn't a live version since this is no longer the most recent.

Here's the original Figma mockup: [Interactive Figma Mockup](https://www.figma.com/proto/TnTYGSRLncLKfOETSyhuZYQf/dhf-interactive-gallery?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=286%2C71%2C0.110861&scaling=scale-down)

Note that the mockup is interactive -- click on the first card entry to display the modal with the Maker Statement.

## Created With:

- React
- Styled Components
- React Spring

## Cloning the Project

If you want/need to build this locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repo
2. cd to the folder and do **yarn install**
3. to start the local development server, run **yarn start**
4. to create a production build, run **yarn build**

The development environment uses the latest alpha version of React, but the production deploy uses the latest stable version.

The app hasn't been ejected from create-react-app, so the bundling and codesplitting is all handled by the default Webpack config.

## TODO:

- Smooth animation when closing modal
- Add parallax scrolling
