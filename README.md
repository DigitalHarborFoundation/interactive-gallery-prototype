# Interactive Project Gallery

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

This is a working prototype for an interactive project gallery for the upcoming Anniversary Showcase.

Youth in VectorFab and Game Workshop will select 1 project to highlight and the program staff will curate the following for each entry:

- Youth first name
- Project title
- Maker statement
- Photo

This will then be turned into an interactive gallery where the course can be selected and the entries will display.

Here's the Figma mockup: [Interactive Figma Mockup](https://www.figma.com/proto/TnTYGSRLncLKfOETSyhuZYQf/dhf-interactive-gallery?node-id=0%3A1&viewport=286%2C71%2C0.110861&scaling=scale-down)

Note that the mockup is interactive -- click on the first card entry to display the modal with the Maker Statement.
