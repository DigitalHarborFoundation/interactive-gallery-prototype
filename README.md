# Interactive Project Gallery

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Created With:

- React
- Styled Components
- React Spring

## Cloning the Project

If you want/need to build this locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repo
2. cd to the folder and do **yarn install**
3. to start the local development server, run **yarn start**
4. to create a production build, run **yarn build**

The development environment uses the latest alpha version of React, but the production deploy uses the latest stable version.

The app hasn't been ejected from create-react-app, so the bundling and codesplitting is all handled by the default Webpack config.

## TODO:

- Smooth animation when closing modal
- Add parallax scrolling
